1. Item Detail

Objective
Build a backend API that provides all necessary data to support an item detail page, inspired by MercadoLibre. Your API should efficiently deliver the required product details and related information in line with best backend development practices.

This exercise focuses exclusively on backend design and implementation.

Requirements
Backend: API Development

Implement an API that supports the frontend by providing the necessary product details

The primary endpoint should fetch product details

Stack:

You can use any backend technology or framework of your choice

Do not use real databases, persist everything in local JSON or CSV files

Non-functional requirements:
Special consideration will be given to good practices in error handling, documentation, testing, and any other relevant non-functional aspects you choose to demonstrate

Tool Usage
Allowed Tools: You may use and are encouraged to use GenAI tools, agentic IDEs, and other code assistance tools to help generate ideas or code.

Documentation & strategic overview
Please include a brief README or Diagram (optional) that explains your API design, main endpoints, setup instructions, and any key architectural decisions you made during development.

Technical strategy:
Detail the chosen technology stack for backend
Explain how GenAI and modern development tools are integrated to improve efficiency

Submission
Provide zipped project folder. This must include the project plan document.
It must contain a run.md explaining how to run the project.
In case any AI productivity tool was used, it is greatly appreciated if you can share the different prompts that were used on prompts.md inside the project.
